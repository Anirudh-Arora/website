                            <p>This project analyzed GeoMIP G6 experiment outputs from the CESM-WACCM model to quantitatively assess the impacts of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) on the South Asian monsoon system. The primary goal was to identify significant changes in precipitation patterns, temperature gradients, and atmospheric circulation resulting from this geoengineering approach.</p>

                            <h3 class="mt-5">Methodology</h3>
                            <p>A comprehensive workflow was developed in Python utilizing libraries such as Xarray, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This allowed for the efficient processing of large-scale NetCDF datasets. Statistical analysis was performed to distinguish the climate signal from natural variability, and results were visualized to communicate the spatial and temporal impacts of SAI.</p>
                            
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>The key finding was a statistically significant shift in monsoon onset and a reduction in overall precipitation, highlighting the complex regional trade-offs of solar radiation management.</p>
                            </blockquote>
