								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>The Garuda Purana¹, an ancient Hindu religious text, stands as a profound repository of wisdom, encompassing narratives, rituals, and teachings that traverse the intricate realms of death and the afterlife. It is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas in Hinduism. Rooted in the Hindu cosmology, this sacred scripture has long guided adherents through the complex rituals associated with death, offering a pathway to transcendence and spiritual liberation. It was written in the form of a conversation between Lord Vishnu and Garuda, his vehicle and the King of Birds, primarily emphasizing the meaning of human life, also containing details of life after death, funeral rites, and rebirth. In the vast spectrum of Hindu spirituality, death is not merely an end but a transition, and the Garuda Purana serves as a guide through this profound journey. The rituals delineated in the Garuda Purana are more than ceremonial routines; they embody a cultural and spiritual link that weaves together the threads of tradition, community, and individual belief. Its influence extends beyond the realm of religious rituals, permeating the fabric of daily life, moral conduct, and communal identity. In the field of anthropology, the exploration of religious texts provides a unique lens into the cultural intricacies that shape beliefs, practices, and community dynamics. As anthropology seeks to unearth the complexities of human societies, the study of religious texts becomes a gateway to understanding the intimate connections between the metaphysical and the mundane.</p>
								<p>This essay endeavours to delve into the complexity of the Garuda Purana, focusing on the ethnographic exploration of death rituals and afterlife beliefs embedded within its verses. Through this essay, I try to highlight the practitioner as well as the receiver's interpretation and engagement with the teachings of the Garuda Purana in the context of death rituals and afterlife beliefs. I also assert on the significance of the Garuda Purana within the broader cultural and religious landscape, particularly concerning the rituals associated with death. This study holds significance in the broader context of religious ethnography and anthropological inquiry as it not only sheds light on the intricate details of Hindu cosmology but also contributes to the vast dialogue on the intersection of religious practices, cultural identity, and the human experience. As an aspiring anthropologist, my aim is not merely to document rituals but to decipher the underlying cultural codes that shape and give meaning to these practices that we mentioned long ago in the Garuda Purana and how they are perceived in modern times. Through this essay, I endeavour to unravel the layers of symbolism, community dynamics, and individual interpretations that converge in the Garuda Purana's verses. In doing so, I aspire to provide nuanced insights that contribute to the ever-evolving discourse on the anthropology of magic, science, and religion.</p>

								<h3>Methodology</h3>
								<p>A comprehensive ethnographic approach was employed to undertake this exploration. The methodological design was crafted to include participant observation, in-depth interviews, and an ethnographic engagement that aimed to transcend mere documentation, delving into the lived experiences and interpretations of individuals immersed in the rituals guided by this ancient Hindu text.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Participant Observation</h4>
                                <p>This was the foundational element in this ethnographic research. By embedding myself within the community practicing the reciting of Garuda Purana after death, I sought to go beyond the surface of the rituals. This allowed for the firsthand understanding of the rituals' dynamics, the roles played by different participants, and the ambient cultural context that surrounds these sacred practices. Over the course of this study, I actively participated in and observed death rituals in two households, thereby gaining insights into the intricate details of the Garuda Purana.</p>
                                
                                <h4>In-Depth Interviews</h4>
                                <p>Complementing participant observation, seven in-depth interviews were conducted with a diverse array of individuals within the community. Key informants included the pandits that recites the Garuda Purana, community elders, and family members of the recently demised person. These structured interviews aimed to understand personal interpretations, beliefs, and the cultural nuances that underpin their relationship with the Garuda Purana.</p>

				<h4>Ethnographic Engagement</h4>
				<p>Informal conversations, participatory activities, and casual observations enriched the information that was used to produce this study, offering a holistic view of the community’s daily life in the times of death and the pervasive influence of the Garuda Purana. This approach facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of how the religious text permeates various facets of individuals’ lives, influencing not one ritualistic moment but also shaping ethical, moral, and social norms within the community.</p>

				<h4>Challenges and Limitations</h4>
				<p>Fieldwork, while invaluable, presented several challenges that influenced the research process. The sensitive nature of death demanded a delicate approach to gain community trust and ensure ethical research practices. It took a lot of time to make people comfortable in sharing their personal experiences, which limited the depth of immersion in some communities, potentially impacting the breadth of experiences captured.</p>
								
                                <h4>Document Analysis</h4>
                                <p>A thorough examination of textual sources, including the Garuda Purana itself, along with transcriptions of interviews, field notes, and observational records, provided a foundational understanding of the sacred text and its contextual interpretations. The collected data was rigorously analysed to identify recurring patterns and variations.</p>

				<h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
				<p>Ethical considerations were paramount, given the sensitive nature of death rituals and religious beliefs. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and confidentiality was assured. Respect for cultural norms and religious sensitivities guided the research process, and any potential harm to participants was rigorously minimized.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
                                <p>In navigating the complexities of the Garuda Purana and its influence on death rituals, this essay is anchored within a theoretical framework that draws upon anthropological concepts and perspectives, aiming to illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of religious practices and cultural dynamics. Methodological Luddism² was practiced while carrying out this study, which further enhanced my understanding of the interpretations of both the sides. The following theoretical considerations guide this exploration into the interplay between the sacred text, cultural beliefs, and individual experiences.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Symbolic Anthropology<sup>3</sup></h4>
                                <p>Building upon the foundations of symbolic anthropology, as advanced by Clifford Geertz and Victor Turner, this essay delves into the symbolic meanings embedded within the death rituals prescribed by the Garuda Purana. Recognizing that rituals are not mere performances but symbolic expressions laden with cultural significance, this framework encourages an exploration of the metaphorical dimensions, cultural symbols, and shared meanings that participants attribute to their actions.</p>

				<h4>Structural Functionalism<sup>4</sup></h4>
				<p>Embracing elements of structural functionalism, a theoretical perspective associated with Émile Durkheim, this essay examines the Garuda Purana's role in maintaining social order and cohesion within the community. According to this framework, religious rituals serve as mechanisms that reinforce societal norms, values, and collective solidarity. By analysing how the Garuda Purana contributes to the social fabric through death rituals, I aim to elucidate the functions of these practices in fostering a sense of community, moral order, and continuity.</p>

				<h3>Community Beliefs and Interpretations as Observed during Fieldwork</h3>
				<p>In the context of the Garuda Purana, my ethnographic engagement revealed a multifaceted understanding that aligns with anthropological inquiry. Participants highlighted three distinct aspects through which they interpret and engage with the sacred text, reflecting the intersection of religious beliefs, cultural practices, and individual experiences.</p>
				<p>Shri Vikrant, a scholar of religion, believes that: </p>
				<blockquote>“We can view Garuda Purana from three different aspects, (i) Darma – as the text serves as a moral compass, providing guidance on virtuous behaviour and the consequences of ethical transgressions, (ii) Devotion or Belief – while devotion is deeply rooted in faith, it also intersects with empirical evidence and observable outcomes. A desire for results that are universally proven, akin to scientific facts is important, as it lend credence to the religious beliefs and practices. This intersection between devotion and empirical validation underscored the complex interplay between belief and reason withing the interpretative framework of the Garuda Purana. (iii) Science – as certain aspects of the text contain knowledge that aligns with scientific principles or offers insights into natural phenomena.”</blockquote>

				<p>A Pandit emphasized on the fact that, </p>
				<blockquote>“Garuda Purana’s interpretation can be either considered as mythology, science or devotion, or all, depending on the perspective of the reader. Individuals may engage with the text in diverse ways based on their cultural background, personal beliefs, and intellectual inclinations.”</blockquote>
				<p>The above understandings reflect the dynamic nature of religious discourse and the ongoing dialogue between tradition and modernity withing Hinduism. </p>

				<h4>The modern world that we live in</h4>
				<p>The observation and reflection on the dependence on machines in contemporary society offer an intriguing lens through which to examine the dynamics of belief and validation withing the context of the Garuda Purana. In this ethnographic exploration, participants raised thought-provoking questions regarding the hierarchy of belief and validation in the realm of human creation, whether it be machines or religious texts like Garuda Purana. Shri Vikrant commented that,</p>
				<blockquote>“In contemporary society, there’s a tendency to accord unquestionable authority to machines and algorithms. The “okay” signal from a machine often triggers acceptance and compliance without further inquiry or validation from humans. This raises a critical question: if humans create machines and imbue them with algorithms, should the validation process not be human-centric rather than machine-centric? In essence, should the creator not hold ultimate authority over the creation, rather than the creation dictating validation to the creator?”</blockquote>
				<p>This introspective inquiry challenges the dichotomy between belief and validation, raising broader questions about the nature of religious belief in contemporary society. It prompts a re-evaluation of the relationship between human agency, belief systems, and the validation of knowledge, inviting deeper reflection on the role of faith, tradition, and critical inquiry in shaping individual and collective worldviews. Drawing parallels to religious beliefs, the Garuda Purana, serving as a written law in religious practice, presents a unique case for examination.</p>

				<h4>The Astral Cord</h4>
				<p>According to this belief system, death marks the severance of the astral cord, the ethereal tether that connects the soul to the physical body during earthly existence. With the astral cord cut, the soul is no longer tethered to the body, allowing it to embark on its journey towards transcendence and enlightenment. However, the Garuda Purana posits that some souls may resist this transition, clinging to the familiarity of the physical body and the illusion of life. In such instances, the soul may linger in a state of denial, attempting to reanimate the lifeless body and resist the inevitable pull of the spiritual realm. This phenomenon may manifest subtly, as observed through slight movements or gestures in the deceased’s body, indicative of the soul’s struggle to accept its departure from the earthly realm. Despite the soul’s reluctance to acknowledge its transition, the severed astral cord serves as a reminder of the irreversible nature of death.</p>

				<h4>End of the Physical Body</h4>
				<p>The directive within the Garuda Purana specifying that the dead body should be cremated within three hours of death holds profound significance rooted in both religious belief and practical considerations. A renowned Pandit explains this as, </p>
				<blockquote>“From a religious standpoint, this timeframe is linked to the concept of Chaitanyata, or the liveliness of the soul even after its departure from the dead body. According to the Garuda Purana, the soul remains in proximity to the body until the cremation rites are performed, drawn by the remnants of vitality that persist within the physical form. Correlating this belief with scientific understanding, the three-hour window aligns with the optimal timeframe for organ preservation and transplantation. Once the pind is completely burnt, the soul sees that its vessel on the physical realm is lost and has merged into the five elements, thereby departing from this realm.”</blockquote>
				<p>Shri Vikrant quotes that,</p>
				<blockquote>“Body is not atman, body is panchpind. The emphasis on timely cremation within the Garuda Purana reflects an understanding of the natural degradation processes that occur within the body post-mortem. Even in the absence of organ donation, the decomposition of bodily tissues begins shortly after death, leading to potential health hazards and environmental concerns if left unchecked.”</blockquote>
				<p>This synchronization between religious prescription and scientific practice underscores the holistic approach to end-of-life care, where spiritual considerations harmonize with medical imperatives.</p>
				<p>While on field, it was observed that the 12-13 days following the death of a person are extremely important and all the rituals are carried out in this timeframe. When asked about this, a Pandit explained:</p>
				<blockquote>“Garuda Purana talks about the concept of a tunnel. the soul embarks on a profound journey upon departing the physical realm, traversing a metaphysical tunnel that serves as a gateway to the spiritual realm. The first 12 days following death hold particular significance in this journey, as the soul navigates through the tunnel and prepares for its entry into the astral plane. During this period, rituals and prayers play a crucial role in facilitating the soul's transition by providing nourishment and positive energy. It is believed that the rituals performed by the living, including prayers, offerings, and acts of devotion, serve as sustenance for the soul, aiding it in its onward journey towards spiritual enlightenment. Moreover, the rituals performed during this period serve a dual purpose: not only do they nourish the soul, but they also help to mitigate any negative emotions or attachments that the soul may carry from its earthly existence. By seeking forgiveness and offering prayers on behalf of the departed, loved ones endeavour to cleanse the soul of any lingering hurt, anger, or resentment, ensuring a smooth passage through the tunnel and into the astral plane.”</blockquote>
				<p>The perspectives shared by community members regarding the relationship between the Garuda Purana and science, as well as the belief surrounding its presence in homes, offer valuable insights into the interplay between tradition, culture, and individual perspectives. The notion that the texts within the Garuda Purana contain scientific knowledge resonates deeply with many community members. They perceive the teachings of the Purana as holding significant relevance to scientific understanding, particularly within the Indian subcontinent where certain concepts may have been corroborated through local empirical observations and practices. However, there exists a perceived disparity between indigenous knowledge systems and the dominant scientific paradigms shaped by Western influence. Despite potential scientific merit, these teachings may not gain universal recognition until validated through Western scientific methodologies, highlighting the complex dynamics of knowledge production and validation in a globalized world.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, the belief among community members that keeping the Garuda Purana in their homes may lead to negative consequences underscores the nuanced relationship between cultural traditions and individual beliefs. This belief reflects a deep-seated reverence for the sacred text, coupled with a sense of apprehension stemming from its perceived graphic and unsettling content. Shri Vikrant's perspective offers a clear interpretation of this belief, suggesting that,</p>
				<blockquote>“The teachings of the Garuda Purana hold inherent value and wisdom, but the graphic nature of its content may deter individuals from keeping it in their homes out of discomfort or fear.”</blockquote>
				<p>The observation that the Garuda Purana is typically recited in households following the death of a loved one sheds light on the ritualistic and symbolic significance attributed to this sacred text within Hindu culture. According to the insights provided by pandits, the commencement of Garuda Purana recitation on the third day after death underscores a deliberate timing that aligns with the belief that the soul has transitioned beyond its earthly connection to the physical body. During the initial three days following death, the focus remains on funeral rites and rituals, culminating in the cremation of the deceased. It is only after this period that the recitation of the Garuda Purana begins, signifying a shift in focus towards the spiritual welfare of the departed soul and the emotional well-being of the bereaved family members. A renowned Pandit explains this as,</p>
				<blockquote>“The rationale behind reciting the Garuda Purana for the family members lies in its transformative potential to instil moral and spiritual teachings that resonate with the universal themes of karma, liberation, and the cycle of rebirth. By engaging with the sacred text, family members are invited to reflect upon the impermanence of life, the consequences of one's actions, and the ultimate quest for spiritual liberation from the cycle of birth and death. The intention is not only to honour the memory of the departed but also to provide solace, guidance, and spiritual nourishment to the grieving family members.”</blockquote>
				<p>It can be summarized that the recitation of the Garuda Purana serves as a vehicle for communal healing, fostering a collective journey towards understanding and acceptance in the face of loss and mortality. It reflects a deep-seated reverence for the wisdom contained within the sacred text and underscores its role as a source of comfort, guidance, and spiritual enlightenment for those grappling with the complexities of life, death, and the eternal journey of the soul.</p>
