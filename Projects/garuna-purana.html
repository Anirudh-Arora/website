								<h3>Abstract</h3>
								<p>This essay explores the significance of the Garuda Purana within Hindu religious tradition, examining its influence on religious practices, beliefs, and cultural dynamics. Drawing upon ethnographic engagement, fieldwork observations, and theoretical analysis, the author investigates the multifaceted dimensions of the Garuda Purana's teachings and their implications for contemporary society. Through ethnographic inquiry, participants revealed diverse interpretations of the Garuda Purana, ranging from ritualistic adherence to scientific validation, highlighting the complex interplay between tradition and modernity. Furthermore, the essay elucidates the role of the Garuda Purana as a repository of moral teachings, spiritual guidance, and cultural identity, emphasizing its enduring relevance in navigating life's existential questions and fostering communal healing in times of loss. This essay contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamic nature of religious belief and practice, bridging the gap between religious discourse and academic inquiry.</p>

								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p>The Garuda Purana¹, an ancient Hindu religious text, stands as a profound repository of wisdom, encompassing narratives, rituals, and teachings that traverse the intricate realms of death and the afterlife. It is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas in Hinduism. Rooted in the Hindu cosmology, this sacred scripture has long guided adherents through the complex rituals associated with death, offering a pathway to transcendence and spiritual liberation. It was written in the form of a conversation between Lord Vishnu and Garuda, his vehicle and the King of Birds, primarily emphasizing the meaning of human life, also containing details of life after death, funeral rites, and rebirth. In the vast spectrum of Hindu spirituality, death is not merely an end but a transition, and the Garuda Purana serves as a guide through this profound journey. The rituals delineated in the Garuda Purana are more than ceremonial routines; they embody a cultural and spiritual link that weaves together the threads of tradition, community, and individual belief. Its influence extends beyond the realm of religious rituals, permeating the fabric of daily life, moral conduct, and communal identity. In the field of anthropology, the exploration of religious texts provides a unique lens into the cultural intricacies that shape beliefs, practices, and community dynamics. As anthropology seeks to unearth the complexities of human societies, the study of religious texts becomes a gateway to understanding the intimate connections between the metaphysical and the mundane.</p>
								<p>This essay endeavours to delve into the complexity of the Garuda Purana, focusing on the ethnographic exploration of death rituals and afterlife beliefs embedded within its verses. Through this essay, I try to highlight the practitioner as well as the receiver's interpretation and engagement with the teachings of the Garuda Purana in the context of death rituals and afterlife beliefs. I also assert on the significance of the Garuda Purana within the broader cultural and religious landscape, particularly concerning the rituals associated with death. This study holds significance in the broader context of religious ethnography and anthropological inquiry as it not only sheds light on the intricate details of Hindu cosmology but also contributes to the vast dialogue on the intersection of religious practices, cultural identity, and the human experience. As an aspiring anthropologist, my aim is not merely to document rituals but to decipher the underlying cultural codes that shape and give meaning to these practices that we mentioned long ago in the Garuda Purana and how they are perceived in modern times. Through this essay, I endeavour to unravel the layers of symbolism, community dynamics, and individual interpretations that converge in the Garuda Purana's verses. In doing so, I aspire to provide nuanced insights that contribute to the ever-evolving discourse on the anthropology of magic, science, and religion.</p>

								<h3>Methodology</h3>
								<p>A comprehensive ethnographic approach was employed to undertake this exploration. The methodological design was crafted to include participant observation, in-depth interviews, and an ethnographic engagement that aimed to transcend mere documentation, delving into the lived experiences and interpretations of individuals immersed in the rituals guided by this ancient Hindu text.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Participant Observation</h4>
                                <p>This was the foundational element in this ethnographic research. By embedding myself within the community practicing the reciting of Garuda Purana after death, I sought to go beyond the surface of the rituals. This allowed for the firsthand understanding of the rituals' dynamics, the roles played by different participants, and the ambient cultural context that surrounds these sacred practices. Over the course of this study, I actively participated in and observed death rituals in two households, thereby gaining insights into the intricate details of the Garuda Purana.</p>
                                
                                <h4>In-Depth Interviews</h4>
                                <p>Complementing participant observation, seven in-depth interviews were conducted with a diverse array of individuals within the community. Key informants included the pandits that recites the Garuda Purana, community elders, and family members of the recently demised person. These structured interviews aimed to understand personal interpretations, beliefs, and the cultural nuances that underpin their relationship with the Garuda Purana.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Document Analysis</h4>
                                <p>A thorough examination of textual sources, including the Garuda Purana itself, along with transcriptions of interviews, field notes, and observational records, provided a foundational understanding of the sacred text and its contextual interpretations. The collected data was rigorously analysed to identify recurring patterns and variations.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Theoretical Framework</h3>
                                <p>In navigating the complexities of the Garuda Purana and its influence on death rituals, this essay is anchored within a theoretical framework that draws upon anthropological concepts and perspectives, aiming to illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of religious practices and cultural dynamics. Methodological Luddism² was practiced while carrying out this study, which further enhanced my understanding of the interpretations of both the sides. The following theoretical considerations guide this exploration into the interplay between the sacred text, cultural beliefs, and individual experiences.</p>
                                
                                <h4>Symbolic Anthropology³</h4>
                                <p>Building upon the foundations of symbolic anthropology, as advanced by Clifford Geertz and Victor Turner, this essay delves into the symbolic meanings embedded within the death rituals prescribed by the Garuda Purana. Recognizing that rituals are not mere performances but symbolic expressions laden with cultural significance, this framework encourages an exploration of the metaphorical dimensions, cultural symbols, and shared meanings that participants attribute to their actions.</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p>In this essay, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the Garuda Purana, delving into its significance as a sacred text within Hinduism and its profound influence on religious practices, beliefs, and cultural dynamics. Through ethnographic engagement, fieldwork observations, and theoretical analysis, I decipher the multifaceted dimensions of the Garuda Purana's teachings, highlighting its relevance in contemporary society and its enduring impact on individual and communal consciousness.</p>
